# yew-base

This repository is intended to be a launching pad for any yew based web applications. 

Take a look [here](./base.md) to see more information on what is included in this launch pad application. 

If you are unfamiliar with Yew, I recommend taking a look at my [primer](https://github.com/Justin-Garey/yew-primer) application so you can become comfortable with the syntax and structure of the application.
